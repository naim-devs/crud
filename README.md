A high-performance, feature-rich, and fully responsive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built entirely with **Vanilla JavaScript**. This project serves as a powerful demonstration of modern frontend development principles without relying on any frameworks or backend services. All data is persisted directly in the browser's **LocalStorage**.
